			<h1>Our History</h1>
			<p>
			The current farm was established in 1930 by Janos-John and Mary Szkiba. After John Sr. died in 1949, Mary and her youngest son John, who was only 17 years old, continued farming until her passing in 1958. John married Jackie in 1963 and along with raising their sons,  farmed until they semi-retired in 1999. Wes and Ledean took over farming, while raising their 3 children. Both John and Jackie could be found helping whenever needed.
 			Spanning over three generations and 90 years, our farm has a commitment to innovation, diversification, and environmental awareness. This innovation and diversification is highlighted throughout our operations, as initially we farmed with horses and then progressed to tractors. The original horse-drawn hay mower and dump-rake are still found on display. Our Irrigation technology started with ditch digging by horse and scraper and letting water flow across the soil. Many days were spent in the field with a shovel. We also pride ourselves in having one of the first Water- driven Pivot irrigation systems in the early 1970’s. Throughout our history we have been able to farm many different crops and raise livestock. This includes sugar beets in the early years, cattle feeding in the 1960’s-1070’s, and growing corn for silage in the late 1970’s to early 1980’s. John was the local “Pioneer” brand seed distributor until early 1990’s. We started modern grain drying and aeration storage in the 1980’s. While raising cows and calves in the 2000’s, we had rotational grazing. This helped manage feed and fertility of the land. Currently, we also participate in crop development with a local seed grower. We are always looking for modern methods and technology to stay ahead of the curve.

			<h1>Our Current Operations</h1>
			<p>Our Current Operations epitomize our steadfast dedication to both environmental sustainability and the timeless values of family farming. Nestled within our operations is a profound commitment to environmental stewardship, where we prioritize the conservation of water resources through the strategic deployment of low flow pivot irrigation systems and meticulous soil moisture monitoring techniques, ensuring that each drop counts. With a conscientious approach to land management, we embrace minimum tillage practices, safeguarding soil health and biodiversity for future generations.
			</p><p>
			Moreover, our ethos of sustainability extends beyond conservation efforts. By integrating GPS-guided systems into our practices, we not only optimize fuel efficiency but also guarantee precision and efficacy in every aspect of our operations. Embracing the symbiotic relationship between agriculture and pollinators, we proudly collaborate with honey producers, welcoming bee hives into our fields to promote biodiversity and enhance crop yields through natural pollination.</p>

			<h1>Our Team</h1>
			<p>Currently our farm is headed by Wes and Ledean Skiba. Wes started working on the same land we currently operate on as a teenager, with his father, John, providing training and guidance. At the time Wes learned to operate cabless tractors and swathers, while also learning about the other aspects of the farm. His knowledge base expanded to wheel line irrigation systems, ditch and siphon flood systems, as well as cattle production. Wes was also an active member in the McNally 4-H Beef Club. Later on Wes received an Agriculture Technology Diploma from Lethbridge College and has since been working on the Farm. Ledean, was also raised on a family farm near Barons Alberta, and is currently involved in the day-to-day operations of the farm, and is also in charge of bookkeeping and records. She was also a part of 4-H, as a member of the Claresholm Centaurs Horse Club, and the Barons Beef Club. Their Children, Coral, Paige, and Reed are also a part of the Farm. Coral and Paige, who work part time, are currently working towards completing their post-secondary education. Reed is also fully trained in machinery operations and works full time on the farm.</p>
